# Enhancing Early Detection of Renal Tumors with Semantic Segmentation
Accurate segmentation of renal tumors from CT images is crucial for effective treatment planning. Manual segmentation is prone to errors and time-consuming, highlighting the need for automated solutions. This project focuses on developing a deep learning model based on the UNet architecture to automate renal tumor segmentation. The model demonstrates promising performance, with potential for identifying tumors at an early stage, even before they fully develop. This study advances automated medical image analysis, aiming to enhance clinical workflows and patient care.
